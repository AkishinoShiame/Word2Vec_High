Andrew Carnegie once the worldfs richest person was born in 1835 to a weaverfs family in Scotland As a child he was expected to follow his fatherfs profession But the industrial revolution destroyed the weaversf craft and the family had to leave for new possibilities in America In 1848 the Carnegies arrived in Pittsburgh then the iron-manufacturing center of the country Young Carnegie took odd jobs at a cotton factory and later worked as a messenger boy in the telegraph office He was often asked to deliver messages to the city theater where he would stay to watch plays by great playwrights He also spent most of his leisure hours in a small library that a local benefactor made available to working boys After the Civil War Carnegie saw great potential in the iron industry He devoted himself to the replacement of wooden bridges with stronger iron ones and earned a fortune He further introduced a new steel refining process to convert iron into steel By 1900 Carnegie Steel produced more of the metal than all of Great Britain However Carnegie often expressed his uneasiness with the businessmanfs life Wishing to spend more time receiving instruction and reading systematically he once wrote gTo continue much longer overwhelmed by business cares and with most of my thoughts wholly upon the way to make more money in the shortest time must degrade me beyond hope of permanent recoveryh The strong desire for intellectual pursuit led him to sell his company and retire at 64 Fond of saying that gthe man who dies rich dies disgracedh Carnegie then turned his attention to giving away his fortune He abhorred charity instead he used his money to help others help themselves He established over 2500 public libraries and sponsored numerous cultural educational and scientific institutions By the time he died in 1919 he had given away 350 million dollars Most parents dread a note or call from school saying that their childfs behavior is gnot normalh If your childfs academic performance and social life is suffering because they donft pay attention canft sit still and act without thinking it is most likely that they have AD/HD Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder AD/HD is a neurological disorder which stems not from the home environment but from biological and genetic causes Its symptoms typically show up in early childhood The main characteristics are inattention hyperactivity and impulsivity Inattentive children have difficulty focusing on completing a task or learning something new Hyperactive children always seem to be restless Often they report that they need to stay busy and may try to do several tasks at once Impulsive children often do not think before they act They often blurt out inappropriate comments or have difficulty taking turns in conversation Most children can be inattentive hyperactive or impulsive at times It is when these behaviors are inappropriate for their age and affect different areas in their lives that the disorder is diagnosed Depression anxiety and learning disabilities may co-exist with AD/HD Therefore if a child is suspected of AD/HD it is very important that he or she be evaluated by a professional Once your child is diagnosed with AD/HD it is important to let the school know so that they can provide appropriate academic and social support Your childfs school should keep this information confidential and it can usually make accommodations in the classroom to fit your childfs learning needs Conflict diamonds sometimes called blood diamonds are diamonds that are sold to fund the unlawful and illegal operations of rebel military and terrorist groups Countries that have been most affected by conflict diamonds are Sierra Leone Angola Liberia and the Democratic Republic of Congo They are places where citizens have been terrorized or even killed by groups in control of the local diamond trade Wars in most of those areas have ended or at least decreased in intensity but the problem of conflict diamonds hasnft gone away Diamonds mined in some rebel-held areas such as Liberia are being smuggled into neighboring countries and exported as conflict-free diamonds In order to stop blood diamond sales South African countries with a legitimate diamond trade began a campaign in 2000 to track the origins of all rough diamonds Their efforts resulted in the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme KPCS an international organization to make the world free of conflict diamonds The goals of the KPCS are to document and track all rough diamonds when they enter a participating country Shippers are required to place those diamonds in sealed boxes and provide enough detailed information about their origins to prove they did not originate in a conflict zone Itfs difficult for most of us to imagine what life is like in countries where diamonds are the source of so much chaos and suffering Furthermore the connection between terror and diamonds is not something thatfs reported heavily in the press The 2006 movie Blood Diamond starring Leonardo DiCaprio should help make the issue more mainstream if only temporarily So take some time to learn more about the problems that conflict diamonds create and then follow your heart the next time you shop for a diamond The Lego Group had a very humble beginning in the workshop of Ole Kirk Christiansen a carpenter from Denmark Christiansen began creating wooden toys in 1932 Two years later he stumbled on the Lego name by putting together the first two letters of the Danish words Leg and Godt which mean gplay wellh The name could be interpreted as gI put togetherh in Latin it also corresponds to the Greek verb meaning ggatherh or gpick uph In 1947 the company expanded to making plastic toys At first the use of plastic for toy manufacture was not highly regarded by retailers and consumers of the time Many of the Lego Groupfs shipments were returned following poor sales However Christiansenfs son Godtfred Kirk Christiansen saw the immense potential in Lego bricks to become a system for creative play As the junior managing director of the Lego Group he spent years trying to improve the glockingh ability of the bricks and made the bricks more versatile In 1958 the modern interlocking brick design was finally developed and patented Today Lego is sold in more than 130 countries Every minute 33824 Lego bricks are made and kids around the world spend 5 billion hours a year playing with Lego There will be more than 400 million people playing with Lego bricks this year On average every person in the world owns 62 Lego bricks and about seven Lego sets are sold every second This year Lego fans all over the world are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the tiny building blocks Though already 50 years old Lego is still the same product it was in the 1950s Bricks bought then are still compatible with current bricks and that is probably the reason the toy has never fallen out of favor During my ninth-grade year I suffered from anorexia nervosa It was not enough to be thin I had to be the thinnest Now however fully recovered I can reflect back and realize that my wishes were more complex than fitting into size five pants Many of my subconscious emotions were related to my relationship with my father As I was growing up his work always came first Sometimes I would not see him for up to two weeks Not only did he devote his whole self to his work but he expected me to do the same gYou cannot get anywhere unless you go to the best universitiesh Though consciously I never felt pressure to please him I began dieting after the first time he told me I looked fat At the time all I knew was that I had to be skinnyskinnier than anyone else Every month my father went to Europe for a week or so and on the days he left sorrow and emptiness consumed me: Daddy was leaving Then I turned to focus on a mysterious weaknessa helpless childlike emotion that came from starving I liked to know that I needed to be taken care of maybe Daddy would take care of me Now two years later and thirty-eight pounds heavier I have come to realize that I cannot alter my fatherfs inability to express his feelings Instead I must accept myself I know that I am a valuable person who strives to achieve and accomplish But I cannot strive solely for others By starving I attempted to gain pride in myself by obtaining my fatherfs approval or acknowledgment of my value as a person But the primary approval must come from me and I feel secure now that I can live with that knowledge safely locked in my mind Africa is a land of many ethnic groups but when Europeans carved Africa into colonies they gave no consideration to the territories of African ethnic groups Some borderlines were drawn that split same groups into different colonies Other borders threw different groups together Sometimes the groups thrown together were enemies When the colonies became independent nations these same borderlines were often maintained Today the Somali people remain split among Ethiopia Kenya Somalia and Djibouti On the other hand almost every African nation is home to more than one ethnic group In Nigeria for example live the Hausa the Fulani the Yoruba the Ibo and many smaller groups Conflicts have arisen over the way in which ethnic groups were split apart and thrown together For example a war between Somalia and Ethiopia was fought because Somalis wanted all their people to be a part of one nation A civil war in Nigeria on the other hand was triggered partly by conflicts between ethnic groups within that nation Similar conflicts between ethnic groups arose in Chad Zaire and Burundi as well One principal goal among African nations today therefore is to help make it possible for their many ethnic groups to live together in peace April 22 2010 will be the 18th celebration of the annual Take Our Daughters to Work Day TOD a project the National Ms Foundation for Women of America NFW developed to expose girls to expanding opportunities for women in the workplace The program offers millions of girls a first-hand view of the many career opportunities available in their futures Now that women make up 46 percent of the US workforce girls can find role models in every occupational fieldfrom politics to molecular biology to professional athletics to name just a few TOD encourages girls to focus on their abilities and opportunities not just their appearance The NFW developed the project more than a decade ago to address the self-esteem problems that many girls experience when they enter adolescence At school boys often receive more encouragement in the classroom especially in math science and computer science the academic fields that tend to lead to the highest salaries Women receive on average only 73 cents for every dollar that men are paid and remain vastly underrepresented in top executive positions and technology fields TOD aims to give girls the confidence and inspiration they need to develop successful careers particularly in non-traditional fields Perhaps because the program had become so widespread and successful TOD had been criticized for excluding boys and it was expanded in 2003 to include boys The programfs official website states that the program was changed in order to provide both boys and girls with opportunities to explore careers at an age when they are more flexible in terms of gender stereotyped roles gWe should also show boys that becoming a child care provider is as acceptable a choice as becoming a police officer or CEOh added Sara K Gould executive director of the NFW In all cultures and throughout history hair has had a special significance In ancient Egypt as long ago as 1500 BC the outward appearance expressed the personfs status role in society and political position Wigs played an important role in this: they were crafted with great artistry and often sprinkled with powdered gold In the 8th century BC the pre-Roman Celts in Northern Europe wore their hair long In a man it was the expression of his strength in a woman of her fertility The idea of long hair as a symbol of male strength is even mentioned in the Bible in the story of Samson and Delilah Samson was a leader of the Israelites His long hair which he never cut gave him superhuman powers The only person who knew his secret was Delilah However she spied for the enemy and betrayed him One night she cut off his hair and thus robbed him of his strength In the classical Greek period curly hair was not only the fashion but it also represented an attitude towards life Curls or locks were the metaphor for change freedom and the joy of living The ancient Greek word for curls and locks is related to intriguing and tempting someone Hair is also used as a symbol of opposition The punk protest movement today uses hair as a symbol of disapproval of the gmiddle-class conventional lifestyleh by wearing provocative haircuts and shockingly colored hair A different form of objection could be seen in the womenfs hairstyles in the 1960s Womenfs liberation was expressed in a short-cut straight and simple hairstyle which underlined equality with men without neglecting female attributes To this day hair has kept its importance as a symbol of power youth vitality and health Camille Mahlknecht 9 has some big fun planned for this weekend She and other residents of Agoura Hills California plan to pick up trash during their cityfs annual cleanup At the same time Wissam Raed 12 will be busy volunteering too Thousands of miles away in Lebanon Wissam plans to put on a play at an orphanage and bring potted plants to elderly people at a senior citizen center Some other children like Nathan White 10 have personal reasons for volunteering Nathanfs grandmother died of a heart attack To help raise money for medical research Nathan participated in Jump Rope for Heart He and five other boys took turns jumping rope for two and half hours and collected more than US 1200 in donations for the American Heart Association Millions of children around the globe lend a hand to their communities every year Schools and parents also contribute to the rise in youth service For example many schools offer community service activities for students to join Teachers either combine volunteer work with classroom lessons or make service work a requirement Parents on the other hand encourage their kids to volunteer and do it with them Community service is particularly important in this recession time As the need for monetary support and other aid has increased many charitable organizations have experienced a significant drop in donations Camille and other children who volunteer thousands of hours annually can fill in some of the gaps According to research kids who start volunteering are twice as likely to continue doing good deeds when they are adults So grab a paintbrush a trash bag or whatever you need to help your community Youfll love how you feel after helping others Even dirty work can be lots of fun if itfs for a good cause Downloading music over the Internet is pretty common among high school and college students However when students download and share copyrighted music without permission they are violating the law A survey of young peoplefs music ownership has found that teenagers and college students have an average of more than 800 illegally copied songs each on their digital music players Half of those surveyed share all the music on their hard drive enabling others to copy hundreds of songs at any one time Some students were found to have randomly linked their personal blogs to music sites so as to allow free trial listening of copyrighted songs for blog visitors or adopted some of the songs as the background music for their blogs Such practices may be easy and free but there are consequences Sandra Dowd a student of Central Michigan University was fined US 7500 for downloading 501 files from LimeWire a peer-to-peer file sharing program Sandra claimed that she was unaware that her downloads were illegal until she was contacted by authorities Similarly Mike Lewinski paid US 4000 to settle a lawsuit against him for copyright violation Mike expressed shock and couldnft believe that this was happening to him gI just wanted to save some money and I always thought the threat was just a scare tactich gYou know everyone does ith added Mike The RIAA Recording Industry Association of America the organization that files lawsuits against illegal downloaders states that suing students was by no means their first choice Unfortunately without the threat of consequences students are just not changing their behavior Education alone is not enough to stop the extraordinary growth of the illegal downloading practice The following report appeared in a newspaper in February 2007 On February 15 2007 hundreds of people came to New York Cityfs famous railroad stationGrand Central Terminalto trade in old dollar bills for the new George Washington presidential US 1 coins The gold-colored coin is the first in a new series by the US Mint to honor former US presidents The Mint will issue four presidential US 1 coins a year through 2016 These coins will come out in the order in which each president served The George Washington coin is the first to be released John Adams Thomas Jefferson and James Madison coins will come out later this year The presidential US 1 coins have a special design For the first time since the 1930s there are words carved into the edge of each coin including the year in which the coin was issued and traditional mottos Each coin will show a different president on its face or heads side It will also show the presidentfs name The other side of the coin will show the Statue of Liberty and the inscriptions gUnited States of Americah and g 1h There are some interesting facts about the coins First there will be one presidential US 1 coin for each president except Grover Cleveland He will have two Cleveland is the only US president to have served two nonconsecutive terms The last president now scheduled to get a coin is Gerald Ford Thatfs because a president cannot appear on a coin when he is still alive In addition a president must have been deceased for two years before he can be on a coin Newspapers have tried many things to stop a seemingly nonstop decline in readers Now France is pushing forward with a novel approach: giving away papers to young readers in an effort to turn them into regular customers The French government recently detailed plans of a project called gMy Free Newspaperh under which 18- to 24-year-olds will be offered a free year-long subscription to a newspaper of their choice Newspaper readership in France has been especially low among young people According to a government study only 10 percent of those aged 15 to 24 read a paid-for newspaper daily in 2007 down from 20 percent a decade earlier Emmanuel Schwartzenberg a former media editor of Le Figaro the oldest and second-largest national newspaper in France said he had strong reservations about the government project At a time when advertising is in steep decline he said newspapers should instead be looking at ways to raise more profits from readers rather than giving papers away gThis just reinforces the belief that newspapers should be free which is a very bad ideah Mr Schwartzenberg said French readers young and old already have plenty of free options from which to choose including newspaper websites and the free papers handed out daily in many city centers Some bloggers said the new program might hold the most appeal to the few young people who do already read and buy newspapers The French government plans to promote the program with an advertising campaign aimed at young readers and their parents However when asked how to attract young readers to the printed press the government said the primary channel for the ads would be the Internet Coffee experts are willing to pay large sums of money for high-quality coffee beans The high-end beans such as Kona or Blue Mountain are known to cost extraordinary sums of money Then there is Kopi Lowak translated as gCivet Coffeeh the worldfs most expensive coffee which sells for as much as US 50 per quarter-pound This isnft particularly surprising given that approximately 500 pounds a year of Kopi Lowak constitute the entire world supply What is surprising is why this particular coffee is so rare In fact itfs not the plants that are rare Itfs the civet droppings Thatfs right the civet droppingsthe body waste of the palm civet Coffee beans arenft Kopi Lowak until theyfve been digested and come out in the body waste of the palm civet Palm civets are tree-dwelling raccoon-like little animals native to Southeast Asia and the Indonesian islands They also have a love for coffee cherries According to Kopi Lowak suppliers palm civets eat the fruit whole but only digest the outer fruit leaving the beans intact While the beans are not destroyed they undergo a transformation in the animalfs body A chemical substance in the digestive system of the palm civet causes some changes to the beans to give them a unique flavor However this is not the only explanation why coffee beans retrieved from civet droppings have a special flavor all their own Another possible reason is that palm civets have an unfailing instinct for picking the coffee cherries at the peak of their ripeness Kopi Lowak is reported to have a character in taste unlike any other coffee complex with caramel undertones and an earthy or gamey flavor Currently most of the worldfs supply of Kopi Lowak is sold in Japan though a few US markets are also starting to stock up on Kopi Lowak Gunter Grass was the winner of the 1999 Nobel Prize in Literature His talents are revealed in a variety of disciplines: He is not only a novelist poet and playwright but also a renowned painter and sculptor As he himself stresses his creations are closely related to his unique personal history His father was a German who joined the Nazi party in World War II while his mother was Polish As a result he constantly suffered contradictory feelings: as a Pole who had been victimized and as someone guilty of harming the Poles The torment in his heart led him to denounce the Nazis and his political activism has continued throughout his career His commitment to the peace movement and the environmental movement as well as his unfailing quest for justice has won him praise as gthe conscience of the nationh In the spring of 1996 he was inspired during a trip to Italy to write a poem with his watercolor brush directly on one of his paintings Before long a collection of his gwater poemsh was born Painting and literature have become his major forms of creativity For him painting is a form of creation with concrete sensual elements while writing is a hard and abstract process When he cannot find words to convey his thoughts painting helps him find the words to express himself In this way Grass not only creates simple depictions of the objects he is fond of in life such as melons vegetables fish and mushrooms but also uses them as symbols for mental associations of various kinds For example to express the complexity of reality he sometimes places unrelated objects in the same painting such as a bird and a housefly or a mushroom and a nail Grass has depicted a wide variety of natural scenes animals and plants and even human artifacts of the German countryside portraying them in poems and allowing words to make the paintings rich in literary value Since the times of the Greeks and Romans truffles have been used in Europe as delicacies and even as medicines They are among the most expensive of the worldfs natural foods often commanding as much as US 250 to US 450 per pound Truffles are actually mushrooms but unusual ones They live in close association with the roots of specific trees and their fruiting bodies grow underground This is why they are difficult to find Truffles are harvested in Europe with the aid of female pigs or truffle dogs which are able to detect the strong smell of mature truffles underneath the surface of the ground Female pigs are especially sensitive to the odor of the truffles because it is similar to the smell given off by male pigs The use of pigs is risky though because of their natural tendency to eat any remotely edible thing For this reason dogs have been trained to dig into the ground wherever they find this odor and they willingly exchange their truffle for a piece of bread and a pat on the head Some truffle merchants dig for their prizes themselves when they see truffle flies hovering around the base of a tree Once a site has been discovered truffles can be collected in subsequent years To enjoy the wonderful flavor of what has been described as an earthly jewel you must eat fresh uncooked specimens shortly after they have been harvested The strength of their flavor decreases rapidly with time and much of it is lost before some truffles reach the market To preserve them gourmet experts suggest putting them in closed glass jars in a refrigerator Another recommendation is to store them whole in bland oil In an ideal world people would not test medicines on animals Such experiments are stressful and sometimes painful for animals and expensive and time-consuming for people Yet animal experimentation is still needed to help bridge vast gaps in medical knowledge That is why there are some 50 to 100 million animals used in research around the world each year Europe on the whole has the worldfs most restrictive laws on animal experiments Even so its scientists use some 12 million animals a year most of them mice and rats for medical research Official statistics show that just 11 million animals are used in research in America each year But that is misleading The American authorities do not think mice and rats are worth counting and as these are the most common laboratory animals the true figure is much higher Japan and China have even less comprehensive data than America Now Europe is reforming the rules governing animal experiments by restricting the number of animals used in labs Alternatives to animal testing such as using human tissue or computer models are now strongly recommended In addition sharing all research results freely should help to reduce the number of animals for scientific use At present scientists often share only the results of successful experiments If their findings do not fit the hypothesis being tested the work never sees the light of day This practice means wasting time money and animalsf lives in endlessly repeating the failed experiments Animal experimentation has taught humanity a great deal and saved countless lives It needs to continue even if that means animals sometimes suffer Europefs new measures should eventually both reduce the number of animals used in experiments and improve the way in which scientific research is conducted Spider webs are one of the most fascinating examples of animal architecture The most beautiful and structurally ordered are the orb webs The main function of the web is to intercept and hold flying prey such as flies bees and other insects long enough for the spider to catch them In order to do so the threads of the web have to withstand the impact forces from large and heavy prey as well as environmental forces from wind and rain for at least a day in most cases The orb web is found to have two main characteristics The first is its geometry which consists of an outer frame and a central part from which threads radiate outward Enclosed in the frame are capture spirals winding round and round from the web center out to the frame The whole web is in tension and held in place by anchor threads which connect the frame to the surrounding vegetation or objects The second and perhaps most important characteristic is the material with which it is built Spider silk is a kind of natural composite that gives this lightweight fiber a tensile strength comparable to that of steel while at the same time making it very elastic Two types of silk threads are used in the web One is highly elastic and can stretch to almost twice its original length before breaking and for most types of spiders is covered in glue This type is used in the capture spiral for catching and holding prey The other is stiffer and stronger and is used for the radius frames and anchor threads which allows the web to withstand prey impact and to keep its structural strength through a wide range of environmental conditions Doctor of Philosophy usually abbreviated as PhD or PhD is an advanced academic degree awarded by universities The first Doctor of Philosophy degree was awarded in Paris in 1150 but the degree did not acquire its modern status until the early 19th century The doctorate of philosophy as it exists today originated at Humboldt University The German practice was later adopted by American and Canadian universities eventually becoming common in large parts of the world in the 20th century For most of history even a bachelorfs degree at a university was the privilege of a rich few and many academic staff did not hold doctorates But as higher education expanded after the Second World War the number of PhDs increased accordingly American universities geared up first: By 1970 America was graduating half of the worldfs PhDs in science and technology Since then Americafs annual output of PhDs has doubled to 64000 Other countries are catching up PhD production has sped up most dramatically in Mexico Portugal Italy and Slovakia Even Japan where the number of young people is shrinking has churned out about 46% more PhDs Researchers now warn that the supply of PhDs has far outstripped demand America produced more than 100000 doctoral degrees between 2005 and 2009 while there were just 16000 new professorships In research the story is similar Even graduates who find work outside universities may not fare all that well Statistics show that five years after receiving their degrees more than 60% of PhDs in Slovakia and more than 45% in Belgium the Czech Republic Germany and Spain are still on temporary contracts About one-third of Austriafs PhD graduates take jobs unrelated to their degrees Today top universities around the world are still picking bright students and grooming them as potential PhDs After all it isnft in their interests to turn the smart students away: The more bright students stay at universities the better it is for academics But considering the oversupply of PhDs some people have already begun to wonder whether doing a PhD is a good choice for an individual A sense of humor is something highly valued A person who has a great sense of humor is often considered to be happy and socially confident However humor is a double-edged sword It can forge better relationships and help you cope with life but sometimes it can also damage self-esteem and antagonize others People who use bonding humor tell jokes and generally lighten the mood Theyfre perceived as being good at reducing the tension in uncomfortable situations They often make fun of their common experiences and sometimes they may even laugh off their own misfortunes The basic message they deliver is: Wefre all alike we find the same things funny and wefre all in this together Put-down humor on the other hand is an aggressive type of humor used to criticize and manipulate others through teasing When itfs aimed against politicians as it often is itfs hilarious and mostly harmless But in the real world it may have a harmful impact An example of such humor is telling friends an embarrassing story about another friend When challenged about their teasing the put-down jokers might claim that they are gjust kiddingh thus allowing themselves to avoid responsibility This type of humor though considered by some people to be socially acceptable may hurt the feelings of the one being teased and thus take a toll on personal relationships Finally in hate-me humor the joker is the target of the joke for the amusement of others This type of humor was used by comedians John Belushi and Chris Farleyboth of whom suffered for their success in show business A small dose of such humor is charming but routinely offering oneself up to be humiliated erodes onefs self-respect and fosters depression and anxiety So it seems that being funny isnft necessarily an indicator of good social skills and well-being In certain cases it may actually have a negative impact on interpersonal relationships On June 23 2010 a Sunny Airlines captain with 32 years of experience stopped his flight from departing He was deeply concerned about a balky power component that might eliminate all electrical power on his trans-Pacific flight Despite his valid concerns Sunny Airlinesf management pressured him to fly the airplane over the ocean at night When he refused to jeopardize the safety of his passengers Sunny Airlinesf security escorted him out of the airport and threatened to arrest his crew if they did not cooperate Besides that five more Sunny Airlines pilots also refused to fly the aircraft citing their own concerns about the safety of the plane It turned out the pilots were right: the power component was faulty and the plane was removed from service and finally fixed Eventually a third crew operated the flight hours later In this whole process Sunny Airlines pressured their highly experienced pilots to ignore their safety concerns and fly passengers over the Pacific Ocean at night in a plane that needed maintenance Fortunately for all of us these pilots stood strong and would not be intimidated Donft just take our word that this happened Please research this yourself and learn the facts Herefs a starting point: wwwSunnyAirlinePilotorg Once you review this shocking information please keep in mind that while their use of Corporate Security to remove a pilot from the airport is a new procedure the intimidation of flight crews is becoming commonplace at Sunny Airlines with documented events occurring on a weekly basis The flying public deserves the highest levels of safety No airlines should maximize their revenues by pushing their employees to move their airplanes regardless of the potential human cost Sunny Airlinesf pilots are

stylized wingless birds the game was first released for Applefs mobile operating system in December 2009 Since then over 12 million copies of the game have been purchased from Applefs App Store With its fast-growing popularity worldwide the game and its charactersangry birds and their enemy pigshave been referenced in television programs throughout the world The Israeli comedy A Wonderful Country one of the nationfs most popular TV programs satirized recent failed Israeli-Palestinian peace attempts by featuring the Angry Birds in peace negotiations with the pigs Clips of the segment went viral getting viewers from all around the world American television hosts Conan OfBrien Jon Stewart and Daniel Tosh have referenced the game in comedy sketches on their respective series Conan The Daily Show and Tosh0 Some of the gamefs more notable fans include Prime Minister David Cameron of the United Kingdom who plays the iPad version of the game and author Salman Rushdie who is believed to be gsomething of a master at Angry Birdsh Angry Birds and its characters have also been featured in advertisements in different forms In March 2011 the characters began appearing in a series of advertisements for Microsoftfs Bing search engine In the same year Nokia projected an advertisement in Austin Texas that included the gamefs characters on a downtown building for its new handset Later a T-Mobile advertisement filmed in Spain included a real-life mock-up of the game in a city plaza Nokia also used the game in Malaysia to promote an attempt to set a world record for the largest number of people playing a single mobile game Angry Birds has even inspired works of philosophical analogy A five-part essay entitled gAngry Birds YogaHow to Eliminate the Green Pigs in Your Lifeh was written by Giridhari Dasar in Brazil utilizing the characters and gameplay mechanics to interpret various concepts of yoga philosophy The piece attracted much media attention for its unique method of philosophical presentation Demolition is the tearing-down of buildings and other structures You can level a five-story building easily with excavators and wrecking balls but when you need to bring down a 20-story skyscraper explosive demolition is the preferred method for safely demolishing the huge structure In order to demolish a building safely blasters must map out a careful plan ahead of time The first step is to examine architectural blueprints of the building to determine how the building is put together Next the blaster crew tours the building jotting down notes about the support structure on each floor Once they have gathered all the data they need the blasters devise a plan of attack They decide what explosives to use where to position them in the building and how to time their explosions Generally speaking blasters will explode the major support columns on the lower floors first and then on a few upper stories In a 20-story building the blasters might blow the columns on the first and second floor as well as the 12th and 15th floors In most cases blowing the support structures on the lower floors is sufficient for collapsing the building but loading explosives on upper floors helps break the building material into smaller pieces as it falls This makes for easier cleanup following the blast The main challenge in bringing a building down is controlling the direction in which it falls To topple the building towards the north the blasters set off explosives on the north side of the building first By controlling the way it collapses a blasting crew will be able to tumble the building over on one side into a parking lot or other open area This sort of blast is the easiest to execute and it is generally the safest way to go All pop artists like to say that they owe their success to their fans In the case of British band SVM itfs indeed true The band is currently recording songs because 358 fans contributed the 100000 needed for the project The arrangement came via MMC an online record label that uses Web-based social-network-style gcrowd-fundingh to finance its acts Herefs how it works: MMC posts demos and videos of 10 artists on its website and users are invited to invest from 10 to 1000 in the ones they most enjoy or think are most likely to become popular Once an act reaches 100000 the financing process is completed and the money is used to pay for recording and possibly a concert tour Profits from resulting music sales concerts and merchandise are split three ways: investors get to divide 40% another 40% goes to MMC the artist pockets 20% The payoff for investors can be big One fan in France who contributed 4250 got his money back 22 times over Crowd-funding musical acts is not new But MMC takes the concept to another level First of all investors can get cash rather than just goodies like free downloads or tickets Also MMC is a record label It has the means to get its music distributed around the world and to market artists effectively gArtists need professional supporth says the CEO of MMCfs international division While digital technology and the Net have created a do-it-yourself boom among musicians success is still a long shot Out of the 20000 records released in the US in 2009 only 14 DIY acts made it to the Top 200 Also with less revenue from recorded music music companies have become less likely to take risks which has led to fewer artists receiving funding The crowd-funding model however allows for more records to be made by spreading risk among hundreds of backers And the social-network aspect of the site helps expand fan bases that is investors become a promotional army In science fiction TV programs such as Star Trek tractor beams are used to tow spaceships and move objects For years scientists have labored to replicate this feat In 2013 they succeeded A team of British and Czech scientists led by Dr Tomas Cizmar say they have created a real-life gtractor beamh like the kind from Star Trek which uses a beam of light to attract objects at least at a microscopic level Light manipulation techniques have existed since the 1970s but this is thought to be the first time a light beam has been used to draw objects towards a light source Usually when microscopic objects are hit by a beam of light they are forced along the direction of the beam After many yearsf research Dr Cizmarfs team discovered a technique that allows for the radiant force of light to be reversed and to use the negative force to draw out certain particles Dr Cizmar says that even though it is a few years away from practical use the technology has huge potential for medical research In particular the tractor beam is highly selective in the particles it can attract so it can pick up particles that have specific properties such as size or composition in a mixture gEventually this could be used to separate white blood cells for exampleh Dr Cizmar told BBC News It has been a primary plot device in science fiction TV programs and movies to allow objects like spaceships to be trapped in a beam of light But Dr Cizmar said this particular technique would not eventually lead to that A transfer of energy happens in the process On a microscopic scale that is OK but on a large scale it would cause huge problems A large object could be destroyed by the heating which results from the massive amount of energy necessary to pull it  Grace Wambui a 14-year-old pupil in Nairobi had never touched a tablet computer But it took her only about one minute to work out how to use one when such devices arrived at Amaf School in Kawangware a slum in the Kenyan capital Teaching used to be conducted with a blackboard and a handful of tattered textbooks Now children in groups of five take turns to swipe the touch screen of the devices which are loaded with a multimedia version of Kenyafs syllabus The tablets at Amaf School are part of a pilot project run by eLimu a technology start-up If it and other firms are right tablets and other digital devices may soon be the rule in African schools Many are betting on a boom in digital education in Kenya and elsewhere Some executives even expect it to take off like M-Pesa Kenyafs hugely successful mobile-money service Such growth in digital education would be timely The flood of new pupils has overwhelmed state schools which were already understaffed underfunded and poorly managed The prospect of Africafs 300 million pupils learning digitally has caught the attention of global technology giants Amazon has seen sales of its Kindle e-readers in Africa increase tenfold in the past year Intel has been helping African governments buy entry-level computers In Nigeria Intel brought together a publisher and a telecom carrier to provide exam-preparation tools over mobile phones a service that has become hugely popular A bigger question is whether digital tools actually improve education Early results are encouraging In Ghana reading skills improved measurably among 350 children that had been given Kindle e-readers In Ethiopia in the absence of teachers children figured out how to use tablets and learned the English ABCs At Amaf School average marks in science went from 58 to 73 in a single term In the Spartathlon one of the worldfs toughest ultra-marathons runners run 245 km about six marathons within 36 hours The runners start in Athens and run all the way to historical Sparta The Spartathlonfs heritage goes back to 490 BC when Pheidippides an Athenian made the journey to Sparta to ask the Spartans for help in fighting the invading Persians It is recorded that he reached Sparta on the day after he left Athens In 1982 this story sparked the interest of a British air-force officer and long-distance runner called John Foden who wondered if it really was possible to run from Athens to Sparta and arrive the next day With four other officers Foden decided to see for himself after a 36-hour slog they arrived in Sparti as the town is now called That achievement inspired the organization of the first Spartathlon a year later The Spartathlonfs attraction has two sources The first is the difficulty of finishing it The Spartathlon is not the most difficult race but it combines lots of different tests There is the heat of the Greek day and then the plunge in temperatures when darkness falls There are climbs: the route includes a series of ascents among them a 1200-meter mountain pass in the dead of night Above all there is the relentless pressure of the clock The second reason is that the idea of retracing Pheidippidesfs footsteps still grips many participants It feels like racing in history passing through places where history began As finishers receive a laurel wreath and water from schoolgirls many are overjoyed with emotion However the euphoria is fleeting Within a few minutes their joints and muscles start to seize up: after the race Sparti resembles the set of a zombie film as participants lumber slowly around on legs that will not bend But the itch to do it all over again soon appears Opened in 1883 the Brooklyn Bridge was the first long-span suspension bridge to carry motor traffic and it quickly became the model for the great suspension bridges of the following century Spanning New Yorkfs East River it provided the first traffic artery between Manhattan Island and Brooklyn Before that the only transportation was by ferries which were slow and could be dangerous in winter The construction of a bridge over the East River had been discussed since the early 19th century but the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861 deflected all consideration of the project When the war ended in 1865 the bridge became an important issue once more In 1867 the New York State legislature passed an act incorporating the New York Bridge Company for the purpose of constructing and maintaining a bridge between Manhattan Island and Brooklyn John Augustus Roebling was chosen to design the bridge Born in Germany in 1806 he held radical views as a student and was listed by the German police as a dangerous liberal He emigrated to America in 1830 to escape political discrimination Roebling proposed a bridge with a span of 1500 feet 465 m with two masonry towers in the East River serving as the main piers The bridge that was actually built is longer1597 feet 486 m the longest suspension bridge at that time The Japanese have long puzzled public health researchers because they are such an apparent paradox: They have the worldfs lowest rates of heart disease and the largest number of people that live to or beyond 100 years despite the fact that most Japanese men smokeand smoking counts as one of the strongest risk factors for heart disease So whatfs protecting Japanese men Two professors at the University of California at Berkeley hoped to find out the answer They investigated a pool of 12000 Japanese men equally divided into three groups: One group had lived in Japan for all their lives and the other two groups had emigrated to Hawaii or Northern California It was found that the rate of heart disease among Japanese men increased five times in California and about half of that for those in Hawaii The differences could not be explained by any of the usual risk factors for heart disease such as smoking high blood pressure or cholesterol counts The change in diet from sushi to hamburgers and fries was also not related to the rise in heart disease However the kind of society they had created for themselves in their new home country was The most traditional group of Japanese Americans who maintained tight-knit and mutually supportive social groups had a heart-attack rate as low as their fellow Japanese back home But those who had adopted the more isolated Western lifestyle increased their heart-attack incidence by three to five times The study shows that the need to bond with a social group is so fundamental to humans that it remains the key determinant of whether we stay healthy or get ill even whether we live or die We need to feel part of something bigger to thrive We need to belong not online but in the real world of hugs handshakes and pats on the back Bitcoin is an experimental decentralized digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone anywhere in the world Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority that is managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively through the network Any transaction issued with Bitcoin cannot be reversed it can only be refunded by the person receiving the funds That means you should do business with people and organizations you know and trust or who have an established reputation Bitcoin can detect typos and usually wonft let you send money to an invalid address by mistake All Bitcoin transactions are stored publicly and permanently on the network which means anyone can see the balance and transactions of any Bitcoin address However the identity of the user behind an address remains unknown until information is revealed during a purchase or in other circumstances The price of a bitcoin can unpredictably increase or decrease over a short period of time due to its young economy novel nature and sometimes illiquid markets Consequently keeping your savings with Bitcoin is not recommended at this point Bitcoin should be seen like a high risk asset and you should never store money that you cannot afford to lose with Bitcoin If you receive payments with Bitcoin many service providers can convert them to your local currency Bitcoin is an experimental new currency that is in active development Although it becomes less experimental as usage grows you should keep in mind that Bitcoin is a new invention that is exploring ideas that have never been attempted before As such its future cannot be predicted by anyone Scientists are trying to genetically modify the world in which we live They are even trying to wipe out diseases via genetic modification For example researchers have tried to engineer mosquitoes to kill malaria parasites The malaria parasite is carried by the female Anopheles mosquito When transmitted to a human the parasite travels first to the liver and then on to the bloodstream where it reproduces and destroys red blood cells An estimated 250 million people suffer from malaria each year and about one million diemany of them children There are currently no effective or approved malaria vaccines To gkillh malaria scientists are genetically modifying a bacterium in mosquitoes so that it releases toxic compounds These compounds are not harmful to humans or the mosquito itself but they do kill off the malaria parasite making the mosquito incapable of infecting humans with malaria Despite this achievement scientists are faced with the challenge of giving the modified mosquitoes a competitive advantage so that they can eventually replace the wild population Complete blockage of the malaria parasite is very important If some of the parasites slip through the mechanism then the next generation will likely become resistant to it And if that happens the scientists are back where they started Another challenge for scientists is to gain public approval for this genetic modification regarding mosquitoes and malaria control Environmental activists have raised concerns about the release of genetically engineered organisms without any clear knowledge of their long-term effect on ecosystems and human health There is still a long way to go before genetic modification techniques are put to use in disease control Faberg eggs are jeweled eggs that were made by the famous Russian jeweler the House of Faberg from 1885 to 1917 The eggs were made of valuable metals or stones coated with beautiful colors and decorated with precious jewels The first Faberg egg was crafted for Tsar Alexander III who gave his wife the Empress Maria Fedorovna an Easter egg to celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary He placed an order with a young jeweler Peter Carl Faberg whose beautiful creations had caught Mariafs eye earlier On Easter morning of 1885 what appeared to be a simple enameled egg was delivered to the palace But to the delight of the Empress the egg opened to a golden yolk within the yolk was a golden hen and concealed within the hen was a diamond miniature of the royal crown and a tiny ruby egg Unfortunately the last two surprises are now lost to history Empress Maria was so delighted by this gift that Alexander appointed Faberg a ggoldsmith by special appointment to the Imperial Crownh The Tsar also asked Faberg to make an Easter egg every year The requirements were straightforward: Each egg must be unique and each must contain a pleasant surprise With excellent craftsmanship and an inventive spirit Peter Faberg and his successors repeatedly met the challenge The House of Faberg made approximately 50 Imperial Easter Eggs for Tsar Alexander III and his son Nicholas II until 1917 when the Russian revolution broke out Today the term gFaberg eggsh has become a synonym of luxury and the eggs are regarded as masterpieces of the jewelerfs art More significantly perhaps they serve as reminders of the last Russian imperial family Six Sigma is a highly disciplined process that helps companies focus on developing and delivering near-perfect products and services The word gsigmah is a statistical term that measures how far a given process falls short of perfection The central idea behind Six Sigma is that if a company can measure how many gdefectsh they have in a commercial production process they can systematically figure out how to eliminate the problems and get as close to gzero defectsh as possible Training and teamwork are essential elements of the Six Sigma methodology In other words companies need to have their team leaders and team members trained to implement the Six Sigma processes They must learn to use the measurement and improvement tools They also need to learn communication skills necessary for them to involve customers and suppliers and to serve their needs Six Sigma was developed in 1986 by Motorola an American telecommunications company Engineers in Motorola used it as an informal name for a plan to reduce faults in production processes A few years later Motorola extended the name gSix Sigmah to mean a general performance improvement method beyond purely gdefect reductionh in the production process In 1995 Jack Welch CEO of General Electrics GE decided to implement Six Sigma in GE and by 1998 GE claimed that Six Sigma had generated over three-quarters of a billion dollars of cost savings By 2000 Six Sigma was effectively established as an industry in its own right involving the training consultancy and implementation of Six Sigma methodology in all sorts of organizations around the world Organizations as diverse as local governments prisons hospitals the armed forces banks and multi-national corporations have been adopting Six Sigma for quality and process improvement Imagine two bottlenose dolphins swimming in the Gulf of Mexico You hear a series of clicks whistles and whines coming from each much like a conversation We canft be sure what they are discussing but scientists do believe dolphins call each other by gnameh A recent study suggests the marine mammals not only produce their own unique gsignature whistlesh but they also recognize and mimic whistles of other dolphins they are close to and want to see again It seems that dolphins can call those they know by mimicking their distinct whistles gTheyfre abstract namesh said Randall Wells one of the authors of the study To conduct the study the researchers listened to recordings of about 250 wild bottlenose dolphins made around Floridafs Sarasota Bay from 1984 to 2009 and four captive dolphins at a nearby aquarium Some wild dolphins were briefly captured and held in separate nets by the research team allowing them to hear but not see each other Researchers found that dolphins familiar with each other would mimic the whistle of another in that group when they were separated Most of this took place among mothers and calves or among males who were close associates suggesting it was affiliative and not aggressivesomewhat like calling out the name of a missing child or friend Whistle copying of this sort was not found in dolphins that happened to cross paths in the wild This use of vocal copying is similar to its use in human language where the maintenance of social bonds appears to be more important than the immediate defense of resources This helps differentiate dolphinsf vocal learning from that of birds which tend to address one another in a more gaggressive contexth If confirmed this would be a level of communication rarely found in nature If dolphins can identify themselves and address friends with just a few squeaks itfs easy to imagine what else theyfre saying However as the authors of the study point out all we can do right now is still imagine With soaring rock formations uniquely-rippled landscapes and mysterious underground cities the Goreme National Park is an incredible tourist attraction in central Turkey Thousands of years ago a group of ancient volcanoes spewed out layer upon layer of thick ash and lava which formed the Cappadocia region where the Goreme National Park is now located Over the centuries the wind and rain worked their magic on this land carving out spectacular gorges and leaving behind the dramatic towering formations of rock pillars that reach heights of 40 meters These amazing structures are usually called gfairy chimneysh They come in an extraordinary range of shapes and sizes but most are tall and resemble king trumpet mushrooms with a cap on top The top stone is the hardest part of each formation and protects the softer rock underneath from erosion Eventually however these caps fall off whereupon the wind and rain start to cut away the cone until it too collapses The unique landforms of the Goreme valley have created its lunar-like landscape also known as a moonscape But the Goreme National Park has always been much more than its dramatic scenery Humans too have left their unique mark on the region The Byzantine Christians inhabited the area in the fourth century They carved thousands of cave churches chapels and monasteries out of rock Many of these churches were decorated with beautiful wall paintings whose colors still retain all their original freshness The Byzantine Christians even carved out entire underground villages in an effort to hide from the Romans and later the Muslims To this day many of these villages are still inhabited and many of the rock-cut storerooms are still stuffed with grapes lemons potatoes and flat bread waiting for the winter Some people call it a traveling museum Others refer to it as a living or open-air museum Built in Brazil to celebrate the quincentennial of Columbusf first voyage to the New World the Nina a Columbus-era replica ship provides visitors with an accurate visual of the size and sailing implements of Columbusf favorite ship from over 500 years ago I joined the crew of the Nina in Gulf Shores Alabama in February 2013 As part of a research project sponsored by my university my goal was to document my days aboard the ship in a blog I quickly realized that I gained the most valuable insights when I observed or gave tours to school-age children The field-trip tour of the Nina is hands-on learning at its best In this setting students could touch the line pass around a ballast stone and move the extremely large tiller that steered the ships in Columbusf day They soon came to understand the labor involved in sailing the ship back in his time I was pleased to see the students become active participants in their learning process The Nina is not the only traveling museum that provides such field trips A visit to Jamestown Settlement for example allows visitors to board three re-creations of the ships that brought the first settlers from England to Virginia in the early 1600s Historical interpreters dressed in period garb give tours to the Susan Constant Godspeed and Discovery These interpreters often portray a character that would have lived and worked during that time period Students touring these ships are encouraged to interact with the interpreters in order to better understand the daily life in the past My experience on the Nina helps substantiate my long-held belief that students stay interested ask better questions and engage in higher-order thinking tasks when they are actively engaged in the learning process The students who boarded the Nina came as passive learners They left as bold explorers An ancient skull unearthed recently indicates that big cats originated in central Asianot Africa as widely thought paleontologists reported on Wednesday Dated at between 41 and 595 million years old the fossil is the oldest remains ever found of a pantherine felid as big cats are called The previous felid record holdertooth fragments found in Tanzaniais estimated to be around 38 million years old The evolution of big cats has been hotly discussed and the issue is complicated by a lack of fossil evidence to settle the debate gThis find suggests that big cats have a deeper evolutionary origin than previously suspectedh said Jack Tseng a paleontologist of the University of Southern California who led the probe Tseng and his team made the find in 2010 in a remote border region in Tibet The fossil was found stuck among more than 100 bones that were probably deposited by a river that exited a cliff After three years of careful comparisons with other fossils using DNA data to build a family tree the team is convinced the creature was a pantherine felid The weight of evidence suggests that central or northern Asia is where big cats originated some 16 million years ago They may have lived in a vast mountain refuge formed by the uplifting Himalayas feeding on equally remarkable species such as the Tibetan blue sheep They then dispersed into Southeast Asia evolving into the clouded leopard tiger and snow leopard lineages and later movements across continents saw them evolve into jaguars and lions The newly discovered felid has been called Panthera Blytheae after Blythe Haaga daughter of a couple who support a museum in Los Angeles the university said in a news release American cooking programs have taught audiences changed audiences and changed with audiences from generation to generation In October 1926 the US Department of Agriculture created this genrefs first official representative a fictional radio host named Aunt Sammy Over the airwaves she educated homemakers on home economics and doled out advice on all kinds of matters but it was mostly the cooking recipes that got listenersf attention The show provided a channel for transmitting culinary advice and brought about a national exchange of recipes Cooking shows transitioned to television in the 1940s and in the 1950s were often presented by a cook systematically explaining instructions on how to prepare dishes from start to finish These programs were broadcast during the day and aimed at middle-class women whose mindset leaned toward convenient foods for busy families Poppy Cannon for example was a popular writer of The Can-Opener Cookbook She appeared on various television shows using canned foods to demonstrate how to cook quickly and easily Throughout the sixties and seventies a few chef-oriented shows redefined the genre as an exhibition of haute European cuisine by celebrity gourmet experts This elite cultural aura then gave way to various cooking styles from around the world An example of such change can be seen in Martin Yanfs 1982 gYan Can Cookh series which demonstrated Chinese cuisine cooking with the catchphrase gIf Yan can cook you can tooh By the 1990s these cooking shows ranged from high-culture to health-conscious cuisine with chefsf personalities and entertainment value being two keys to successful productions At the beginning of the 21st century new cooking shows emerged to satisfy celeb-hungry reality-crazed audiences In this new millennium of out-of-studio shows and chef competition reality shows chefs have become celebrities whose fame rivals that of rock stars Audiences of these shows tend to be people who are interested in food and enjoy watching people cook rather than those who want to do the cooking themselves leaving the age-old emphasis on following recipes outmoded Screaming is one of the primal responses humans share with other animals Conventional thinking suggests that what sets a scream apart from other sounds is its loudness or high pitch However many sounds that are loud and high-pitched do not raise goose bumps like screams can To find out what makes human screams unique neuroscientist Luc Arnal and his team examined a bank of sounds containing sentences spoken or screamed by 19 adults The result shows screams and screamed sentences had a quality called groughnessh which refers to how fast a sound changes in loudnessWhile normal speech sounds only have slight differences in loudnessbetween 4 and 5 Hz screams can switch very fast varying between 30 and 150 Hz thus perceived as being rough and unpleasant Arnalfs team asked 20 subjects to judge screams as neutral or fearful and found that the scariest almost always corresponded with roughness The team then studied how the human brain responds to roughness using fMRI brain scanners As expected after hearing a scream activity increased in the brainfs auditory centers where sound coming into the ears is processed But the scans also lit up in the amygdala the brainfs fear center The amygdala is the area that regulates our emotional and physiological response to danger When a threat is detected our adrenaline rises and our body prepares to react to danger The study discovered that screams have a similar influence on our body It also found that roughness isnft heard when we speak naturally regardless of the language we use but it is prevalent in artificial sounds The most aggravating alarm clocks car horns and fire alarms possess high degrees of roughness One potential application for this research might be to add roughness to alarm sounds to make them more effective the same way a bad smell is added to natural gas to make it easily detectable Warning sounds could also be added to electric cars which are particularly silent so they can be efficiently detected by pedestrians There is a lot to see and do in Bangkok if you can tolerate the traffic noise heat in the hot season floods in the rainy season and somewhat polluted air The city is incredibly urbanized but beneath its modern appearance lies an unmistakable Thai-ness To say that Bangkok is not Thailand as has been claimed by some is like saying that New York is not America Paris is not France or London is not England Bangkok caters to diverse interests: there are temples museums and other historic sites for those interested in traditional Thai culture an endless variety of good

childrenfs welfare after he took them to the zoo covered in strange bright-colored veils gto protect them from kidnappersh The pop star was pictured walking through Berlin Zoo with his two elder children Prince Michael five and Paris four Both youngsters had their faces completely covered in outlandish see-through burgundy-colored veilsa choice of dress which Jacksonfs aides said was designed to disguise the youngsters to protect them from being kidnapped But as they wandered through the zoo with their famous father it seemed an unlikely explanation The rare appearance came just 24 hours after the singer provoked outrage by dangling his youngest child baby Prince Michael II from the fourth-floor balcony of a hotel window The nine-month-old boyfs face was covered with a white cloth which was again said to be a precautionary measure taken by the star to protect his children from becoming kidnappersf targets As people across the world criticized Jackson as an unfit father child protection groups called on German police to take action against the pop legend However Berlin prosecutors said they were not investigating the incident and an inquiry could only be opened if a complaint was filed against Jackson Since the terrorist attack on America on September 11 hundreds of new security measures have been put in place to make Americans safer or at least feel safer Hotels and corporate offices now require guests to present a photo ID at check-ins and entrances Airlines refuse to let passengers carry razor blades scissors or screwdrivers on flights At least one surefire way exists to improve security and protect personal privacy: positive passenger bag-matching It would require that no checked bag be transported on a plane if its owner doesn't board the flight Bag-matching became standard practice in Europe and Asia in the 1980s after suitcase bombs brought down Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie Air India Flight 182 en route to London and UTA Flight 772 to Paris In all three cases the terrorists weren't on board Yet in the US where security is now top priority authorities have chosen to ignore bag-matching Instead the Transportation Safety Administration TSA has embraced largely untested electronic-detection systems that screen bags for bombs and other explosives Critics charge that the TSA has overlooked such an obvious sensible security measure because US airlines have opposed bag-matching for years They fear it might delay flights and persuade short-haul travelers to take a train or drive instead After September 11 bag-matching was back on the agenda Yet struggling airlines complained that implementing it on all domestic flights would drive them into bankruptcy Such claims have zero merit says Arnold Barnett a former chair of the Federal Aviation Administration's technical team In 1996 the team was asked to investigate the feasibility of bag-matching In a 1997 experiment which tested 11 airlines 50 pairs of cities 8000 flights and 750000 passengers Barnett showed that domestic bag-matching would cause delays averaging seven minutes on only one in seven flights and would require no reduction in flight schedules Barnett argues that bag-matching would deter bombers far more than electronic-detection systems It ensures that the terrorist will proceed to the gate to board his plane If while he's waiting detection devices reveal a bomb he could be quickly located and arrested gThe combination of bag-matching and explosives detection could be far more potent than either measure on its ownh Barnett wrote in a Dec 17 letter to TSA chief He received a thank-you note that contained no indication that the TSA is contemplating action These days even a walk in the woods can be transformed into an gextremeh sport Take ggeocachingh for example Hikers looking for something a little different on their treks created a global hunting game hiding gcacheshpacks filled with goodies like CDs

adviser to Solomon R Guggenheim asking the architect to design a new building to house Guggenheimfs four-year-old museum of Non-Objective Painting The project evolved into a complex struggle pitting the architect against his clients city officials the art world and public opinions Both Guggenheim and Wright would die before the buildingfs 1995 completion The resultant achievement the Solomon R Guggenheim Museum testifies not only to Wrightfs architectural genius but also to the adventurous spirit that characterized its founders Wright made no secret of his disenchantment with Guggenheimfs choice of New York for his museum: gI can think of several more desirable places in the world to build this great museumh Wright wrote in 1949 to his partner gbut we will have to try New Yorkh To Wright the city was overbuilt overpopulated and lacked architectural merit Still he proceeded with his clientfs wishes considering locations on 36th Street 54th Street and Park Avenue all in Manhattan as well as in the Riverdale section of the Bronx before settling on the present site on Fifth Avenue between 88th and 89th Streets Its nearness to Central Park was key As close to nature as one gets in New York the park offered relief from the noise and congestion of the city Wrightfs design put his unique stamp on Modernist Architecturefs rigid geometry The building is a symphony of triangles ovals arcs circles and squares The delicate vision took decades to be fulfilled Some people especially artists criticized Wright for creating a museum environment that might overpower the art inside gOn the contraryh he wrote git was to make the building and the painting an uninterrupted beautiful symphony such as never existed in the world of art beforeh In conquering the regularity of geometric design and combining it with the plasticity of nature Wright produced a vibrant building whose architecture is as refreshing now as it was 40 years ago The Guggenheim is arguably Wrightfs most eloquent presentation and certainly the most important building of his late career In recent years a craze for height has hit hard in industrializing Asian countries like Taiwan Hong Kong and China which boast seven of the worldfs 10 tallest buildings The current tallest at 101 floors is the Taipei 101 in Taiwan though Torontofs CN Tower is 180 feet higher largely because of its huge antenna Yet

upset the 43-century reign of Egyptfs Great Pyramid of Giza Dr Thompson was pleased Just three months after moving to the small Midwestern town he had been invited to address an evening meeting of the Chamber of Commerce Here was the perfect opportunity to show his knowledge of modern medicine and to get his practice off to a flourishing start With this in mind the doctor prepared carefully On the night of his speech Dr Thompson was delighted to see that the meeting hall was full After being introduced he strode confidently to the lectern and announced his topic: gRecent Advances in Medicineh He began with a detailed discussion of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease a rare brain disorder that had recently been covered in the New England Journal of Medicine Next he outlined the progress that had been made in studying immune system disorders Just about this time halfway through his speech Dr Thompson began to notice a certain restlessness in his audience People were murmuring and shuffling their feet Someone in the fourth row seemed to be glancing at a newspaper Nevertheless Dr Thompson plowed on He had saved the best for last He quoted extensively from an article in the Lancet about genetic research feeling sure his audience would be impressed by his familiarity with this prestigious British medical journal Then the speech was over Dr Thompson had expected to be surrounded by enthusiastic people congratulating him and asking questions Instead he found himself standing alone Finally the president of the Chamber of Commerce came up to him gSomething tells meh said Dr Thompson gthat my speech was not very successful I canft understand it I worked so hard to make it interestingh gOh it was a fine speechh replied the president gBut maybe it would have gone over better with a different audience Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is not exactly a factor in these peoplefs everyday experience You know here we are in January If youfd talked about ways to avoid getting the flu youfd have had them on the edge of their seatsh When a company ventures into new markets it will need to face various problems These problems can be broadly classified into several categories including 1 cultural factors 2 economic issues 3 geographical factors 4 political/legal issues 5 religious factors and 6 technological issues Find an appropriate category for the problems discussed in each of the following paragraphs A company will face problems of this kind as it is an alien when compared to the business climate of the country Coca-Cola for instance was faced with such a problem in India when it was given a choice of either to reveal its secret formula or leave the country Coke chose to leave But when it was welcomed back after several years it was subjected to harassment and constant interference from the political activists Problems of this kind can make an impact on the properties of a product This impact forces a company to adapt its products in order to meet the needs of the local market To solve the problems the level of economic development in a market should be assessed for example by the level of revenue buying power of local consumers and by the state of infrastructure in the foreign market These indicators can provide vital information to the company regarding its marketing strategy These problems are perhaps the biggest issue a researcher can come across while studying new markets This is because markets that can be classified as similar on various grounds tend to be dissimilar when it comes to this particular aspect There are differences even within the same country Accordingly travel advertising in Canada is divided between the English audience and the French audience While pictures of travel advertisements show a wife alone for the English audience a man and wife are shown for the French audience This is done because the French are more bound by family ties Rice balls with folded plastic wrappers separating the rice from the

symbol of appreciation love and care Packaging has therefore attained an important place in Japanfs economy The packaging market is worth over 74 trillion New packaging is introduced to Japanese store shelves at a rate of 20 percent per year the highest rate in the world In such an environment a product has to have more than just a nice graphic design to differentiate it from its shelf-mates The product has to speak to the consumerfs needs with both personality and practical value In this changing industry nothing is really certain except one thing You can be sure that the goods out there on display on the shelves of the convenience store will soon be looking rather different Native Americans could not understand the white manfs war on the wolf The Lakota Blackfeet and Shoshone among other tribes considered the wolf their spiritual brother They respected the animalsf endurance and hunting ability and warriors prayed to hunt like them They draped themselves in wolf skins and paws hoping they could acquire the wolffs hunting skills of stealth courage and stamina Plains Indians wore wolf-skin disguises on raiding parties Elite Comanche warriors were called wolves The white settlersf war on the wolf raged on Western ranchers continued to claim that thousands of cattle were killed every year by wolves In 1884 Montana created its first wolf bountyone dollar for every dead wolf which increased to eight dollars in 1893 Over a period of thirty-five years more than eighty thousand wolf carcasses were submitted for bounty payments in Montana Moreover the government even provided free poison Finally in 1914 ranchers persuaded the United States Congress to provide funds to exterminate wolves on public lands The last wolves in the American West died hard No place was safe not even the nationfs first national park Yellowstone The park was created in 1872 and from its very beginning poisoned carcasses were set out to kill wolves Nearly 140 wolves were killed by park rangers in Yellowstone from 1914 to 1926 In October 1926 two wolf cubs were trapped near a bison carcass They were the last animals killed in the parkfs wolf control programs Ranchers had won the war against the wolf Only in the northern woods of Wisconsin Minnesota and Michigan could the howl of native gray wolves be heard The vast lands of the American West fell silent The country had lost its greatest predator Recently Dr Stuart Campbell of a private health center in London published some ultrasound images of unborn babies between 26 and 34 weeks The smiles of the babies in the pictures greatly shocked the public and were widely circulated on the Internet For the past two years the doctor has used the medical facility in the center and has offered state-of-the-art 3-D/4-D scanning services to expectant parents He performs an average of 30 scans a week His outspoken enthusiasm for this blessed technology is refreshing gParents love themh he said gI hear so many couples laughing

herself as a gmedical sociologisth says the photos are simply misleading and ridicules the anti-abortion lobby for being gintoxicated with evidence of a fetusf humanityh Australian Birth Control Services medical director Geoff Brodie complained that the photos gwill be picked up by those groups that use anything and everything to stop abortions but ignore the fact that women have a right to choiceh In America the pro-abortion lobby is having the same hostile reaction It was bad enough when conventional 2-D sonograms revealed unborn hearts beating and blurry hands waving but the abortionists are absolutely aghast over rapidly spreading access to 3-D/4-D ultrasound technology A writer for the liberal American Prospect said that the new technology gblurred the distinction between a fetus and a newborn infanth Despite these strong reactions from the pro-abortionists the right of life takes precedence over a womanfs right to choice After all nothing can be more
